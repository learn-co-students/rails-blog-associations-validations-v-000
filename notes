Create a migration, model and controller for User and Tag (via rails generate). Check out the documentation on generators, and remember to skip adding tests.
      rails g resource User name:string  --no-test-framework
      rails g resource Tag name:string  --no-test-framework

In order to create the appropriate associations between Post and Tag, we need to create a join table as well.
      rails g model Post_Tag post_id:integer tag_id:integer

Build out model associations and migrations.
      post_tag  (join table)
              belongs to post
              belongs to tag
      post
              belongs to a user
              has many tags through post_tags (also needs a has many post_tags)
      tag
              has many posts through post_tags (also needs a has many post_tags)
      user
              has many posts
              

Be sure to create the appropriate routes. For now, they can be written as resources. (default with rails g resource)

create the database, migrate the schema, and seed it.
      current seed file gives context for User and Tag content

Make the model association tests pass.

Model Validations
      Post for the presence of both name and content
      User for the uniqueness of name
      Tag for the uniqueness of name


Build out forms for creating a new post to incorporate errors

Create a form on the posts form page that lists all the tags as checkboxes, allowing a user to select multiple tags.
