Change migration for Post to include content (make content text to account for character length).

Create a migration, model and controller for User and Tag (via rails generate). Check out the documentation on generators; you should be skipping adding tests.

In order to create the appropriate associations between Post and Tag, we need to create a join table as well.

Build out model associations and migrations.

Be sure to make the appropriate routes. For now, they can be written as resources.

create the database, migrate the schema, and seed it.

Make the model association tests pass.
